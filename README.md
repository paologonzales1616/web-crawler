### Technologies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

### Algorithms

* [TF-IDF](http://www.tfidf.com/) - Tf-idf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.
*[Vector space model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model) - Vector space model or term vector model is an algebraic model for representing text documents as vectors of identifiers, such as, for example, index terms. It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings. Its first use was in the SMART Information Retrieval System.
